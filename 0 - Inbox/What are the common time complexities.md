# What are the common time complexities

time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm based on input, we refer to the worst-case scenario as Big O notation. It has several complexities, among them the following ones are the most common:

- **O(1):** or *constant time* this is the most efficient algorithm as the execution time is constant and doesn't change, eg: *accessing an array by index*, *finding median from sorted array*.

- **O(log n):** or *logarithmic time* comes second place in terms of efficiency after *O(1)*, execution time increases by the number of input as *log n*. eg: *binary search*.

- **O(n):** or *linear time*, the time taken by algorithm increases as the input, eg: *linear search*, *Kadane's algorithm*

- **O(nÂ²):** or *quadratic time*, this algorithm's time increases quadratically eg: *bubble sort*, *insertion sort*.
