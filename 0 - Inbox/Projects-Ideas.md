# Startup Ideas

## **Project Definition & Roadmap: "AI-Powered Workspace"**

### **Phase 1: The Long-Term Vision**

This is the ultimate goal, the "North Star" for the entire project. It's what the initial idea described.

- **Core Principle:** A single, clean interface to manage your entire professional life, primarily through natural language (text and voice).
- **Full Feature Set:**
  - **Email (The Command Center):** Full Gmail/Outlook client with an AI command bar (`/ai...`) and conversational voice control for triage, searching, and drafting.
  - **Calendar (The Time Manager):** Integration with Google Calendar to manage schedules via natural language ("book a meeting with Alice"). Automated event creation from email content with conflict resolution.
  - **Tasks (The Action Engine):** Integration with task managers (Trello, etc.) for voice/text-based task creation and AI-powered prioritization (e.g., Eisenhower Matrix).

### **Phase 2: The First Launchable Product (The "AI Command Inbox")**

This is the first version we would aim to charge for after validating the core concept.

- **Core Principle:** The fastest, most intelligent way to get through your inbox.
- **Feature Set:**
  - A clean, fast, fully-functional Gmail client (read, draft, reply, archive, etc.).
  - The text-based **AI Command Bar** is the central feature for all actions.
  - **AI Smart Search** that understands natural language context.
  - **The "Interactive Briefing"**: An AI-generated narrative summary ("Good morning. You have 3 emails from your boss...") for a conversational experience.
  - Full **Trust & Security** commitment (clear policies, transparent operations).

### **Phase 3: The Immediate MVP (The "Triage Engine") - OUR CURRENT FOCUS**

This is the hyper-focused experiment we will build first. Its only purpose is to answer the question: **"Is an AI-generated briefing a valuable way for users to triage their inbox?"**

- **Core Principle:** Prove the value of AI-powered email prioritization with the minimum possible code and risk.
- **MVP Features (What's IN):**
  - **Google OAuth:** Securely connect a Gmail account.
  - **Read-Only Access:** The _only_ permission we will ask for, to maximize user trust.
  - **Single-Action UI:** A single button ("Get My Briefing") to trigger the analysis.
  - **Smart Grouping Output:** The AI will analyze the latest unread emails and present them in collapsible groups ranked by importance.
- **What's Explicitly OUT of this MVP:**
  - No composing, replying, archiving, or deleting.
  - No full inbox view.
  - No voice interaction.
  - No calendar or task features.
  - No complex command bar.

## **MVP Core Design & User Journey**

This section details the specific design of the Phase 3 MVP.

### **1. The Actionable Triage Summary (The Core AI Output)**

Each email within a group will be summarized into a small "card" with this structure:

- **From:** [Sender Name]
- **Subject:** [Original Email Subject]
- **Gist:** [AI 1-sentence summary of the key point.]
- **Action Required:** [AI-determined category: "Reply Needed," "Task to Complete," "For Your Information," etc.]

### **2. The User Journey (First-Time Experience)**

- **Step 1: The Landing Page**

  - **Headline:** `Your inbox, prioritized. Instantly.`

- **Step 2: The Authentication**

  - **Button:** `Sign in with Google`
  - **Reassurance Microcopy:** `"We will only request read-only access to summarize your unread emails. We will never send, delete, or modify anything in your account."`

- **Step 3: The Onboarding (While waiting)**

  - A **skeleton UI** will appear, and a small text area will cycle through messages to explain the process:
    1.  `"Connecting securely to your inbox..."`
    2.  `"Fetching your latest unread emails..."`
    3.  `"Analyzing content to identify key actions..."`
    4.  `"Ignoring newsletters and promotional fluff..."`
    5.  `"Grouping conversations by importance..."`
    6.  `"Building your personalized briefing..."`

- **Step 4: The "Aha!" Moment (The Main UI)**
  - The screen will populate with a clear headline and the prioritized, collapsible list of groups.
  - The emails would be chosen based on: recent, unread and importance
  - **Example Layout:**
    ## **Your Morning Briefing is Ready.**
    ### **[>] From: Sarah (Your Boss) (2)**
    ### **[>] Project Phoenix Update (3)**
    ### **[>] Newsletters (5)**

This document now serves as our complete blueprint for the MVP. It's clear, structured, and actionable.

Now, returning to my previous question, let's switch our thinking hats from "Product Designer" to "Engineer."

**What is the single biggest technical challenge or bottleneck you foresee in the process of fetching emails, running the AI analysis, and sending the data back to the client? How might we mitigate it?**
