- use useRef when you dont need to show UI
- use url as a state
- use normal variables if its calculated
- Use external store hook for client-only
- Use selector for less rerendering 
- Start with useState -> refactor better -> simplify
- fetch on server instead on client 
- useTransition for async
- use formdata since browser handles it if you're just submitting forms
