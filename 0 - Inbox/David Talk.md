- use useRef when you dont need to show UI
- use url as a state
- use normal variables if its calculated
- Use external store hook for client-only
- Use selector for less rerendering 
- Start with useState -> refactor better -> simplify
- fetch on server instead on client 
- useTransition for async
- use formdata since browser handles it if you're just submitting forms
- useActionState in nextjs
- group data together
- use descriminated unions ir better state when fetching
- calculate when its not expensiv
- indirect state management (useReducer) is simple and can be extendable (track changes, testability...etc)
