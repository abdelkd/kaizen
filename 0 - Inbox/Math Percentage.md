**Definition:** a percentage is a way to represent a number out of a whole, where a whole is 100%. % symbol here is used to represent "percentage"

## Percentage to Decimal
To convert a percent value to a decimal all we have to do is divide it by 100.

**Examples:**
- 25% = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- 4% = 4 / 100 = 0.04

## Decimal to Percentage
In order to convert a decimal to percentage, we simply multiply the decimal value by 100.

**Examples:**
- 0.05 = 0.05 * 100 = 5%
- 0.76 = 0.76 * 100 = 76%

## Percentage to Fraction 
To represent a percentage as a fraction, we turn the value to a fraction of 100 and simplify it if possible.

**Examples:**
- 25% = 25/100 = 1/100
- 60% = 60/100 = 3/5

## Fraction to Percentage
In order to convert a represent a fraction as a percentage, we divide the numenator by the denominator and then multiply by 100.

**Examples:**
- 4/5 = (4 / 5) * 100 = 0.8 * 100 = 80%
- 12/18 = (12 รท 18) * 100 = 0.66 * 100 = 66%
## Finding a Percentage of a Number

**Examples:** what is 34% of 44?
- 34 / 100 = 0.34
- 0.34 * 44 = 14.96%

## Finding what percentage a number is to another
You may want to find what percentage a number is to another (say 7 to 14). We divide the first number by the second number and multiply by 100.

**Examples:**
- 14 / 7 = 0.5
- 0.5 * 100 = 50%

## Finding the whole from a percentage 
Suppose we want to find the whole when a percentage is given (30 is 60% fo what) to do that we multiply the number by percentage (in its decimal form).

**Examples:**
- 30 / 0.60 = 50
