# What is the design thinking process

Design thinking process aims at finding and solving user's problems by following the non linear process.

1. **Empathize:** we try and put ourselves in user's shoes and understand their pain points.
2. **Define:** in this step we define the problems we're trying to solve based on the previous *empathize* step.
3. **Ideate:** after defining the problem, this step aims to gather as much ideas for solving the problem as possible and the choosing the proper one that align with feasibility and desirability.
4. **Prototype:** here we try implement a basic prototype of the chosen ideas, prototype must be minimal and more focused on the idea.
5. **Test:** After making prototypes we test them in users and refine
