# Hello world example in Hono

Hono is a simple framework, so simple that its possible to start making APIs in less than 5 minutes.
## 1. Initializing the Project

To initialize the project we start with the following command:

```sh
pnpm create hono@latest <project_name>
```

This command will initialize a Hono project.

## 2. Understanding the APIs routing

Inside of the created folder there's `src/index.ts`
