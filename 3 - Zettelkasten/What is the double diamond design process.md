# What is the double diamond design process

This is a design process that consists of two diamonds next to each other, each diamond refers to a key phase and is split in half which makes it 4 phases of design. 

1. **Discover:** this is a divergent process, we gather insights from the users and research about their problems.
2. **Define:** after gathering insights, we try and define the challenges. This is a convergent process.
3. **Develop:** In this divergent process, we develop solutions for users and stakeholders.
4. **Deliver:** this is a convergent process, we test the developed solutions and deliver the ones that achieve the goal and are desirable by the users and stakeholders.
