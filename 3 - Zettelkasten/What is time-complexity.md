# What does time-complexity mean in Algorithms

Time complexity in theoretical computer science, refers to the amount of computer time it takes an algorithm to finish. It is used to provide a high level understanding of the efficiency of the algorithm's performance. Time complexity commonly expressed as Big O Notation (eg: O(n), O(log n), O(1)...) and used to compare efficiency of different algorithms
